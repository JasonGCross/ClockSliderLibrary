/**
 An abstract idea to keep track of how many times someone "goes around" a circular clock face.
 The user slides his finger (or mouse) in a circular arc around a clock. Any new dragging is the first time
 (rotation count = first). If the user continues dragging through the initial drag position (more than a 360
 degree rotation), then the count increments (rotation count = second).
 The count can never be more than 2. If the user keeps dragging past the second count, the count
 remains at the second.
